  <h3>A Fall Weekend for Car Enthusiasts</h3>
  <p>
    Please mark your calendar for September 10-12, 2020, and plan to be in
    Highlands for Mountain Motoring â€“ a fall weekend for car enthusiasts.
    Included in the event are two days <em>(YES, TWO DAYS!)</em> of our popular One
    Lap of the Mountains driving tours and "High Octane in the Park," - a bring-what-you-got,
    no registration required, unjudged car show. In keeping with Highlands Motoring
    Festival tradition, all proceeds from these events will benefit our charities.
