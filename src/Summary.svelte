  <h3>A Fall Weekend for Car Enthusiasts</h3>
  <p>
    This is primarily a driving event with tour routes designed to take
    advantage of the area’s twisty back roads that are less traveled. The
    route’s designers are fellow enthusiasts who want to share hidden secret
    roads. The run groups are limited in size to allow each group to stay
    together and enhance fellowship among enthusiasts.

  <p>
    Sunday’s "High Octane in the Mountains" is intended to be a low key
    gathering of interesting cars and their owners who will want to share their
    stories of a great weekend.
