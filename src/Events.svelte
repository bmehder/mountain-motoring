    <h4>Friday, September 10, 2021</h4>
    <p>
      A shorter version of One Lap of the Mountains. Like the original,
      extremely popular One Lap of the Mountains, this event is a mountain
      driving experience beginning in the Kelsey-Hutchinson Park on Pine Street,
      traveling backroads to a lunch stop, and returning by a different route to
      Highlands. The round-trip mileage of the tour is around 80 miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers are divided into two groups. The first group will be for drivers
      who want a more spirited drive and a faster pace. The second group will
      have a slower pace that allows for enjoying automobile, road, and nature
      in harmony.
      <em>Registration is required.</em>

      "One Lap of the Mountains Grande" will roll out of Highlands in two groups
      on an approximate 175 mile driving adventure. The 2021 One Lap route has

      roads stopping for lunch before returning via different route. <em
