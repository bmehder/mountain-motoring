    <h4>Friday, September 10, 2021</h4>
    <p>
      A shorter version of "One Lap of the Mountains". Like the original,
      extremely popular "One Lap of the Mountains", this event is a mountain
      driving experience beginning at the Kelsey-Hutchinson Park on Pine Street,
      traveling backroads to a lunch stop, and then returning by a different
      route to Highlands. The round-trip mileage of the tour is around 80 miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers are divided into two groups. The first group will be for drivers
      who want a more spirited drive and a faster pace. The second group will
      have a slower pace that allows for enjoying automobile, road, and nature
      in harmony. Participants will receive a dash plaque, two HMF hats, and the
      2021 HMF poster.
    </p>
    <p><em>Registration is required.</em></p>

      "One Lap of the Mountains Grande" returns to its traditional format and
      will roll out of Highlands in two groups on an approximate 175 mile
      driving adventure. The carefully curated route will travel the areaâ€™s
      winding mountain roads stopping for lunch before returning to Highlands
      via a different route. Participants will receive a dash plaque, two HMF
      hats, and the 2021 HMF poster.
