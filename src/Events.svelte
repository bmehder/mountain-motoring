    <p>
      A shorter version of “One Lap of the Mountains”. Like the original,
      extremely popular “One Lap of the Mountains”, this event is a mountain
      driving experience beginning at the Kelsey-Hutchinson Park on Pine Street.
      After a complementary hot breakfast, we will travel the back roads with a
      rest stop, and then return by a different route to Highlands. The
      round-trip mileage of the tour is around 80 to 100 miles and returning to
      Highlands in time for lunch, shopping and enjoying the afternoon in the
      Town of Highlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shorter drive may be more appealing to those with the “classic cars”.
      Registrants will be eligible for a drawing to win a Porsche Experience
      ticket. Participants will also receive a “Mountain Motoring” dash plaque
      along with two HMF hats.

      “One Lap of the Mountains” returns to its traditional format and will roll
      out of Kelsey-Hutchinson Park on Pine Street in two groups on an
      approximate 175 mile driving adventure. The carefully curated route will
      travel the area's winding mountain roads stopping for lunch, where
      participants are on their own to order from a diverse menu, before
      returning to Highlands via a different route.
