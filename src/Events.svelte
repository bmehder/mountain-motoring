  <h4>Friday, September 10, 2021</h4>
  <p>
    A shorter version of One Lap of the Mountains. Like the original, extremely
    popular One Lap of the Mountains, this event is a mountain driving
    experience beginning in the Kelsey-Hutchinson Park on Pine Street, traveling
    backroads to a lunch stop, and returning by a different route to Highlands.
    The round-trip mileage of the tour is around 80 miles. Drivers are divided
    into two groups. The first group will be for drivers who want a more
    spirited drive and a faster pace. The second group will have a slower pace
    that allows for enjoying automobile, road, and nature in harmony.
    <em>Registration is required.</em>

    "One Lap of the Mountains Grande" will roll out of Highlands in two groups
    on an approximate 175 mile driving adventure. The 2021 One Lap route has
    been designed to offer an excellent driving experience on winding mountain
    roads stopping for lunch before returning via different route. <em
