  <p>
    At 4118 feet, Highlands NC is surrounded by national forests and wonderful

    test.

    > has created this "driverâ€™s experience" to take advantage of the ideal season
    between the peak summer months and the October fall color season. It is a time
    with better lodging availability, moderate temperatures, and less congested roads.
