  <h3>A Unique Mountain Driving Experience</h3>
  <p>
    In the blink of an eye, the vintage motoring calendar changed lanes without
    putting on a turn signal! As a result of the shelter-in-place orders, garage
    doors were locked down tight, and the classic car events schedule skidded to
    a halt with numerous cancellations and postponements. The Highlands Motoring
    Foundation board of directors had to cancel Juneâ€™s 2020 <a
      href="https://highlandsmotoringfestival.com/"
      target="_blank">Highlands Motoring Festival</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    In its place, Highlands Motoring Foundation will host Mountain Motoring, a
    September event for our loyal patrons as well as newcomers.
